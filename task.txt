Write the blog on the difference between document and window Objects

Document Object:

1)Represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
2)Operates within the context of the loaded HTML document.
3)Deals with the hierarchical structure of the document, including elements like '<html>', '<head>', and '<body>'.
4)Provides methods to access and manipulate DOM elements within the document, such as 'getElementById()' and 'querySelector()'.
5)Facilitates content manipulation by dynamically creating, modifying, or removing elements and content.
6)Handles events related to user interactions or document loading, such as 'DOMContentLoaded' or 'load'.

Window Object:

1)Represents the browser window containing the DOM document.
2)Serves as the global execution context for JavaScript code in the browser.
3)Deals with browser-related functionalities and properties, including navigation, timers, and window dimensions.
4)Provides access to methods like 'window.open()' for opening new browser windows.
5)Contains properties for accessing information about the window's size and position, such as 'window.innerWidth' and 'window.scrollY'.
6)Facilitates cross-origin communication between windows or frames using methods like 'postMessage()'.
